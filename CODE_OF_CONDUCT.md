# Code of Excellence

## Purpose

The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to ensure a productive, merit-focused environment for our open-source project. It outlines the values and expectations that enable contributors to collaborate effectively while pursuing excellence. By participating in this project, you agree to uphold these guidelines, which prioritize reason, individual initiative, technical merit, professionalism, freedom of thought, and respect earned through contribution.

## Principles

* **Rational Self-Interest:** Contributions are voluntary and driven by mutual benefit. We recognize that contributors participate to further their own goals (such as learning, improving the software, or gaining experience) in alignment with the project’s objectives. There is no expectation of self-sacrifice; by contributing, individuals advance both the project and their own rational interests.

* **Individual Responsibility & Excellence:** Every contributor is accountable for their actions and the quality of their work. We value initiative and expect individuals to take ownership of their tasks, learn from mistakes, and continuously improve. Striving for excellence is a core value – each person should do their best to uphold high standards in code, documentation, and collaboration.

* **Meritocracy (Contributions Over Identity):** This project is a meritocracy. The value of ideas, feedback, and work is judged solely on its merit and technical quality, not on who you are. Personal characteristics (such as background, demographics, or beliefs) are irrelevant to technical collaboration. Respect and influence in the community are **earned** by meaningful contributions and proven competence – they are not granted automatically or based on identity. Everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute, and all contributions will be considered fairly on their merits.

* **Freedom of Thought and Expression:** We encourage open discussion, constructive criticism, and the free exchange of ideas within the scope of the project. Contributors are free to express their thoughts regarding the project’s design, code, and direction without fear of censorship or reprisal. Diverse viewpoints and honest debates are welcome, **provided they remain relevant to the project and grounded in reason.** We do not silence or dismiss contributors for holding dissenting opinions about the project’s technical matters. (Note that inflammatory off-topic rhetoric or non-constructive negativity is not “free expression” – it will be moderated to keep discussion productive.)

* **Focused and Civil Discourse:** Our collaboration centers on technical ideas and facts, not personal feelings or sensitivities. Disagreements and critiques should target the content of ideas, code, or proposals – never personal attributes. All participants are expected to remain civil and professional. This means no insults, no personal attacks, and no attempts to shame or guilt others. We understand that constructive feedback, even if blunt, is aimed at improving the project. Contributors are encouraged not to take offense to fact-based critiques of their work. Likewise, when providing feedback, do so courteously and with evidence or reasoning. The goal is to keep discussions rational, respectful, and laser-focused on solving problems and improving the project.

## Expectations

To uphold the above principles in daily project interactions, all community members (contributors, maintainers, and users) are expected to follow these guidelines:

* **Stay On-Topic and Project-Focused:** Keep discussions, issue comments, and pull request feedback centered on the project’s goals and technical subject matter. Avoid bringing unrelated political, ideological, or social issues into project spaces. Our collaboration is about building great software; outside agendas have no place here.

* **Evaluate Contributions Objectively:** Assess code and proposals based on their technical merit. When giving feedback, be specific, factual, and focused on the work itself. For example, point out bugs, suggest improvements, or discuss trade-offs in design. Do not dismiss an idea due to who suggested it; conversely, do not accept substandard work out of sympathy. Every idea should stand or fall on its merits.

* **Accept Constructive Criticism:** When you receive feedback or critiques of your contribution, approach it with an open mind. Do not respond with personal offense or defensiveness to well-reasoned critiques. Instead, address the substance of the comments. Remember that all participants aim to improve the project. Appreciate honest feedback as a chance to learn or refine your work.

* **Provide Constructive Feedback:** When you critique someone else’s work, do so respectfully and with the intention to help, not to belittle. Focus on **what** is wrong or could be improved and **why**, rather than on **who** made the mistake. Offer suggestions for improvement and, when possible, solutions. Keep your tone civil and your comments focused on the issue, not the person.

* **No Personal Attacks or Harassment:** Under no circumstances should you engage in personal insults, name-calling, ad hominem arguments, or threats. Debate ideas without attacking the individual. Harassment, stalking, or sustained personal criticism has no place in this project. In particular, do not target anyone with remarks about personal traits (e.g. race, gender, religion, etc.) – as stated, those are irrelevant here. We define harassment narrowly, as behavior that a reasonable person would find hostile or oppressive. Critiquing code or ideas is **not** harassment; making repeated personal remarks or refusing to drop a topic after a colleague has asked to move on **is** considered harassment. Be aware of boundaries during discussions.

* **Self-Reliance and Asking for Help:** We encourage everyone to be resourceful and take initiative in solving problems (e.g., searching documentation or experimenting) – do your homework before asking others to do it for you. That said, asking for help or clarification is welcome when you’ve made an effort on your own. If you seek help, be clear about what you’ve tried and what specific question you have. Others will gladly assist with focused questions, but do not expect anyone to simply do your work for you. Each individual is responsible for the tasks they take on.

* **Responsibility in Commitments:** If you volunteer for an issue or promise to deliver a feature, strive to follow through. Honor your commitments or update the team early if you cannot. Do not assume someone else will clean up behind you. Taking responsibility builds trust and demonstrates merit.

* **Equal Opportunity to Contribute:** Any contributor, new or experienced, has the right to propose changes, file issues, or take on tasks. Experienced members should welcome newcomers’ contributions on their merits. Conversely, newcomers should recognize that respect and trust are earned over time. Everyone gets the chance to try, to fail, and to succeed here. We don’t preemptively exclude anyone from participating; the only expectation is that you bring effort and a willingness to learn.

* **No Entitlement or Disruption:** Being a member of the project is a privilege, not a right. If your ideas are not adopted or if others disagree with your suggestions, do not resort to hostility or persistent arguing. Constructive debate is welcome, but once a decision is made, accept it gracefully. Do not derail discussions or reopen settled topics without new information. If you continually find yourself at odds with the project’s direction or community, you may need to reconsider whether this is the right project for you (and you are always free to fork the project under the open-source license if you desire a different direction).

## Governance

This project operates under a **Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL)** governance model, with minimal bureaucracy. The BDFL is the project founder or designated lead maintainer who has ultimate responsibility for project decisions. While we encourage discussion and input from all contributors, the BDFL serves as the final decision-maker to keep the project unified and moving forward.

* **Role of the BDFL:** The BDFL (Project Lead) guides the project’s vision and has the authority to make final calls on any aspect of the project, including technical disputes, acceptance of contributions, roadmap direction, and the interpretation/enforcement of this Code of Conduct. The BDFL is expected to exercise this authority in a fair and reasoned manner, with the project’s best interest in mind, acting as a “benevolent” leader.

* **Minimal Oversight:** We keep formal processes and bureaucracy to a minimum. There are no large governing committees. Instead, trust is placed in individuals to follow the principles and in the BDFL to resolve issues when necessary. Day-to-day, contributors are empowered to collaborate and make decisions (through consensus or discussion) on routine matters. Only when conflicts arise or decisions affect the broader project direction does the BDFL typically step in to adjudicate.

* **Advisors and Core Contributors:** The BDFL may appoint core maintainers or advisors to assist with managing the project. These individuals might review pull requests, guide newcomers, or make recommendations. However, such roles are granted based on merit and demonstrated ability. They remain advisory in nature; the BDFL retains final authority. All leadership positions in the project are earned by ongoing contribution and competence, not by election or by personal identity factors.

* **Leadership Transitions:** The “for Life” in BDFL implies long-term stewardship. However, if the BDFL steps down or is unable to continue, a successor may be appointed (for example, the current BDFL might designate a replacement, or a core team might choose one based on meritocratic consensus). The guiding principle is that leadership should be held by someone with a strong track record of contribution and alignment with the project’s values and goals. We avoid abrupt power shifts or politicized takeovers; continuity and merit will guide any leadership change.

## Reporting Issues

We expect most disagreements or minor issues to be resolved through direct, rational communication between the parties involved. However, if you encounter behavior that **clearly violates** this Code of Conduct and cannot be resolved informally, you should report it. We aim for a simple, fair reporting process:

1. **Self-Resolution First:** If possible, address the issue directly with the individual(s) involved. Often a respectful conversation can clear up misunderstandings or miscommunications. Give them a chance to hear your concerns and respond. Many issues can be resolved between adults acting in good faith, without formal escalation.

2. **When to Report:** If an issue is serious (e.g. clear harassment, repeated disrespect of the guidelines) or if you have attempted to resolve it without success, you can report it to the project maintainers. The primary contact for Code of Conduct issues is the BDFL (or a designated moderator, if one exists). You may report by contacting **\[Project Lead’s email or preferred contact method]**. Include details of the incident, including dates, what was said or done, and any context. Be factual and avoid inflammatory language in your report.

3. **Confidentiality:** Reports will be handled with discretion. The contents of your report will typically be shared only with those who need to know in order to investigate and address the issue (usually the BDFL and possibly a small trusted subset of core maintainers, if their input is needed). We do not tolerate retaliation against anyone who reports an issue in good faith.

4. **Investigation and Response:** The BDFL will review the report and may reach out for additional information if necessary. They will evaluate the situation objectively against this Code of Conduct. Actions in response to a confirmed violation may range from a private warning or mandated apology, to removal of offending content, up to temporary or permanent expulsion from the project (in cases of severe or repeat violations). The specific action will depend on the severity of the violation and the context, as determined by the BDFL’s judgment.

5. **False or Malicious Reports:** Submitting a report that is intentionally misleading or in bad faith (for example, to harass someone you disagree with) is itself a serious breach of this Code of Conduct. Such behavior will be addressed by the BDFL in the same manner as other violations. We want the reporting process to be used only for genuine concerns.

## Final Authority

By joining this project’s community, you acknowledge that the standards and processes outlined in this Code of Conduct are critical for our success and you agree to abide by them. The interpretation and enforcement of this Code of Conduct rest with the project’s leadership, specifically the BDFL.

The **BDFL’s decisions are final** in all matters related to the project, including conflict resolution and disciplinary actions. While the BDFL will consider input from others and strive to be just and rational, once a decision is made it will be carried out in the interest of protecting the project’s integrity and goals. Participants who cannot accept the BDFL’s guidance or the project’s foundational principles are free to leave the project. In open source, forking the project’s code or pursuing an alternative direction is always an option if you strongly disagree – what is not acceptable is to remain within the project and attempt to undermine its values or leadership.

This Code of Conduct is meant to foster an environment of trust, innovation, and excellence. It does not override applicable laws or regulations; all members must also abide by relevant laws (for example, regarding harassment, discrimination, etc.). The project leadership will adjust and interpret these rules in good faith as needed to uphold a fair and productive community.

**In summary, we commit to a culture of reason, merit, and mutual respect earned through action.** Thank you for being a part of this project and for helping to uphold these standards. Let’s build something great together, by the strength of our ideas and the quality of our work.
