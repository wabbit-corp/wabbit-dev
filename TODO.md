See dev/checks/*.py for check TODOs.

* [ ] Gitignore and Config Files: Ensure every repository has a .gitignore file tailored to
      the project’s language and tooling.

* [ ] Require or auto-generate dependency graphs: For complex repos, generate a dependency graph (or a tree) that
      gets checked into the repo or uploaded somewhere. This helps with dependency audits and clarity around
      how everything ties together.
* [ ] Repository Topics/Tags: (For organizational consistency) Assign relevant topics or tags to each repository
      (especially open source ones on GitHub) to classify them. This isn’t a code rule per se, but it’s part of
      repository quality on GitHub.
* [ ] {AI} Usage and Example Documentation: Provide usage examples, command-line instructions, or API examples as appropriate.
