# Kotlin Conventions

This file is the shared Kotlin coding guide used by setup-managed repos.

## Language and API Modeling

- Use `sealed interface` or `sealed class` to model algebraic data types.
- Prefer `data class` and `data object` for data-bearing cases.
- Prefer composition and delegation over inheritance.
- Prefer immutable state and `val` by default.
- Use `@JvmInline value class` wrappers for real domain boundaries such as IDs, counts, and units.

## Coroutines and Concurrency

- Use `kotlinx.coroutines` for async and concurrency.
- Expose `suspend` APIs in libraries.
- Bridge to blocking contexts only at CLI, test, or boundary code.

## Serialization

- Prefer `kotlinx.serialization` with `@Serializable` models.
- Use custom serializers only when the wire format or invariant actually requires them.
- Use `@SerialName` when external field names differ from Kotlin names.

## HTTP and Networking

- Prefer Ktor `HttpClient` for HTTP work.
- Default to the CIO engine unless the repo has a stronger reason not to.
- Install `ContentNegotiation` with JSON where appropriate.
- Configure timeouts and check response status explicitly.
- Accept `HttpClient` via constructor or parameters where practical.

## Experimental and Internal APIs

- Gate unstable internal APIs with `@RequiresOptIn`.
- Keep `@OptIn` scope as small as practical.
- Do not let experimental annotations spread further than necessary.

## Error Handling

- Prefer explicit result algebras or domain-specific exceptions over vague failure channels.
- Fail fast on violated invariants with `require`, `check`, or assertions as appropriate.
- Carry enough structured context in exceptions to debug the failure later.

## Design Bias

- Favor acyclic structure at the file and module level.
- Prefer fewer sources of truth.
- Prefer fewer representations when multiple types model the same concept.
- Make illegal states harder to express.
