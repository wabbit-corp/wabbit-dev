'''
* [ ] Remove Dead or Debug Code: Regularly purge any commented-out code, leftover debug print statements,
      or temporary test fragments before merging. These clutter the repository and can confuse new contributors.
      This rule can be partially automated by scanning for specific keywords (TODO, FIXME, console.log, etc.)
      and ensuring they are addressed or removed in production code. While not all TODO comments need removal,
      they should at least be tracked and not forgotten indefinitely.
* [ ] Check for Very Old TODO/FIXME Comments: Identify TODO, FIXME, or similar marker
      comments that haven't been modified in a very long time (e.g., several years),
      as they might indicate forgotten tasks, dead code references, or obsolete information.
