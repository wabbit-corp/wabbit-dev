"""
* [ ] Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date: Regularly update dependencies to incorporate security patches and improvements.
* [ ] Pin and Lock Dependencies: Use explicit version pinning and lock files for all dependencies to ensure reproducible builds.
* [ ] Remove Unused Dependencies: Periodically audit each repository for dependencies that are not actually
      used in the code. This can be automated with tools (like depcheck for Node or pip-autoremove for Python)
      that detect imports vs. declared dependencies.
* [ ] License Compliance for Dependencies: All dependencies should have licenses compatible with your projectâ€™s
      license (especially important for open source releases).
