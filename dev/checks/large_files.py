* [ ] Prevent accidentally committing large artifacts (e.g., media, huge binaries, etc.)
      or logs that blow up repo size unnecessarily.
* [ ] Avoid Checked-in Binary Dependencies: Do not commit dependency binaries or libraries
      directly into the repo (no libs/ folder with .jar, .dll, etc.). Use package managers
      or repositories for third-party code.
