# Wabbit Dev Toolkit

This repository contains a collection of Python utilities used to automate
various development workflows.  The entry point for the command line interface
is `dev.py` which exposes a number of subâ€‘commands for project management,
repository checks, publishing, dependency analysis and more.

The code lives primarily inside the `dev/` package.  It includes helpers for
working with Git repositories, interacting with GitHub, generating banners,
and running quality checks across a repository.  Several tasks are implemented
under `dev/tasks`, for example:

* `check` â€“ run linting and repository validation checks
* `dep/graph` â€“ output a graph of project dependencies
* `dep/updates` â€“ report outdated dependencies
* `commit` and `push` â€“ Git helper commands
* `setup` â€“ initialise a new repository using templates

Tests for various modules are located in `dev/test_*.py`.
